- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dave McDonald (@davidsmcdonald)
I'm an eternally curious software developer with a passion for creative problem solving.
I'm skilled in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, and Back-End Web Development, and enjoy working all parts of the stack.
I love being part of a great team, both as a learner and a mentor, and always happy to connect!
